📄 README 
Ecommerce Data Analysis Project (Python + SQL)
📌 Overview
This project is a comprehensive E-commerce data analysis pipeline that leverages Python, MySQL, and data visualization tools to uncover business insights from transactional datasets.
It demonstrates how raw e-commerce CSV files are cleaned, imported into a MySQL database, queried using SQL, and then visualized using Python libraries like matplotlib and seaborn.

📁 Dataset Overview
The project processes and analyzes the following datasets:

customers.csv

orders.csv

sallers.csv

products.csv

geolocation.csv

payments.csv

order_items.csv

These datasets represent different aspects of an e-commerce platform, including customer details, order transactions, seller profiles, product listings, and payment records.

🔧 Tools and Technologies
Python: Data preprocessing, analysis, and visualization.

MySQL: Data storage, transformation, and SQL-based querying.

Pandas: DataFrame handling and data cleaning.

Matplotlib & Seaborn: Visualization and pattern recognition.

🚀 Key Features
Automated data ingestion from CSV to MySQL using pandas and MySQL Connector.

Dynamic table creation with data type inference.

SQL queries for customer behavior and product insights.

Visualization of geographic distributions, payment trends, and top-performing products.
